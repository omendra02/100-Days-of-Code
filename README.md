# 100-Days-of-Code
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge repository! This is where I document my journey as I commit to coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Whether it's learning a new programming language, working on personal projects, solving coding challenges, or contributing to open-source projects, I'll be sharing my progress, thoughts, and learnings here.

Main Goals:

Consistency: Code for at least an hour every day, no exceptions.

Learning: Focus on mastering key programming concepts and technologies.
